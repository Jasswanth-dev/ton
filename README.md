## 📒 Developer Notes & Challenges Faced

1. **Background Video Embedding**: One of the major challenges was embedding a full-screen video that loops infinitely without sound — handled via `<video muted loop autoplay>` and styled for full coverage.
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: The original UI didn't include a mobile design, so a custom mobile layout was crafted using media queries to ensure usability on smaller screens.
3. **Missing Tablet Image**: The assignment did not provide a separate image for tablet view. To maintain visual appeal, a border-radius and shadow effect were applied to the existing terminal image within a custom skewed frame.
4. **Muted Background Video**: The video is meant purely for visual enhancement and thus was muted to prevent disruption to the user experience.
5. **Learning to Use `transform: skew()`**: A skew effect was used on the tablet frame to enhance design aesthetics. As this was a new concept, it took some time to achieve the desired visual output.
